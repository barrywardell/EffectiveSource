EffectiveSource
===============

Numerical code for computing the effective source for a point particle moving
in a curved background spacetime

Getting the code
----------------
The latest version of this code is always available from the project's git
repository at

  git://github.com/barrywardell/EffectiveSource

Description
-----------
This code compute the singular field and effective source for a point scalar
particle following an equatorial geodesic orbit in Kerr.

Definitions:
 * x is the 4-dimensional location of the field point.
 * x_p is the location of the particle.
 * M is the mass of the background Kerr black hole.
 * a = J/M is the spin of the black hole in units of M.
 * m is the mode in the m-modes scheme.

Usage
-----
All publicly provided functions are listed in the header file effsource.h.
Briefly, the code may be used as follows:

1. Call effsource_init(M, a) at startup to set the mass and spin of the
   central black hole.

2. Call effsource_set_particle(x_p, e, l, ur_p) every time the particle's
   position (x_p), or constants of motion (e, l) change. Here, ur_p is only
   used to determine the sign of the radial component of the four-velocity,
   i.e. whether it is currently moving inwards or outwards.

3. To compute only the singular field, call effsource_PhiS(x, PhiS) or
   effsource_PhiS(m, x, PhiS).

4. To compute the effective source, call
   effsource_calc(x, PhiS, dPhiS_dx, d2PhiS_dx2, src) or
   effsource_calc(x, PhiS, dPhiS_dx, d2PhiS_dx2, src). This will also compute
   the singular field and its derivatives.

For a detailed demonstration of the usage, see the example provided in the
test dirctory.

Requirements
------------
This code requires the GNU Scientific Library in order to provide for the
calculation of elliptic integrals. The test code also makes use of the ODE
integration routines in the GNU Scientific Library.

Compiling
---------
To compile the code, add the effsource.h header to the list of includes in
your code and then compile either kerr-circular.c or the four files
kerr-equatorial-coeffs.c, kerr-equatorial-dtcoeffs.c,
kerr-equatorial-dttcoeffs.c and kerr-equatorial.c with the rest of your code.

Some of these files can take a large amount of time and RAM to compile, in
particular the file kerr-equatorial-dttcoeffs.c. I have found llvm-gcc 4.2.1
from Apple's Xcode to do much better than gcc 4.6 in this regard.

To compile the example, change to the test directory and run make.
